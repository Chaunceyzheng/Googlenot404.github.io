>《Sherlock》第三季第二季 The sign of three  

**Ladies and gentlemen, family and friends,and...um, others**;

**John Watson. My friend John Watson. John... When John first broached the subject of being Best Man, I was confused**.

**I confess at first i didn't realize he was asking me, when finally i understood i expressd to him that i was both flattered and surprised. I explained to him that i'd never expected this request and i was a little daunted in the face of it**.

**I nonetheless promised that i would do my very best to accomplish a task which was, for me,as demanding and difficult as any i had ever contemplated. Additionally, i thanked him for the trust he placed in me and indicated that i was, in some way,very close to being moved by it.**

**It later transpired that i'd said none of this out loud.**

**I'm afraid John, i can't congratulate you. All emotions and in  particular love, stand opposed to the pure,cold reason i hold above all things. A wedding is, in my considered opinion, nothing short of a celebration of all that is false and specious and irrational and sentimental in this ailing and morally compromised world. Today we honor the deathwatch bettle that is the doom of our society and in time one feels certain our entire speccies. But anyway, let's talk about John.**

**If i burden myself with a little helpmate during my adventures, this is not out of sentiment or caprice, it is that he has many fine qualities of his own, that he has overlooked in  his obsession with me.**

**Indeed, any reputation i have for mental acuity and sharpness comes in truth, form the extraordinary contrast John so selflessly provides. It is a fact, i believe, that brides tend to favor exceptionally plain bridesmaids for their big day. There is a certain analogy there, i feel, and contrast is, after all, God's own plan to enhance the beauty of his creation. Or it would be if God were not a ludicrous fantasy designed to provide a career oppotunity for the family idiot.**
